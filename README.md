# Low frequency noise measurement in graphene transistors

- Developed a Python script to communicate with SR760 (Spectrum Analyser) and integrated the same with 2400 Keithley Source Measurement Units using pyvisa and pymeasure for development.
- Implemented and handled the software setup of low frequency noise measurements for Graphene
FETs.
- Used SCPI commands to communicate withe hardware. This setup will be used to measure low frequency noise in wafer level devices fabricated by the research group

Tech Stack - Python, PyVisa, PyMeasure, Labview, Hardware Programming, SCPI commands, Numpy
